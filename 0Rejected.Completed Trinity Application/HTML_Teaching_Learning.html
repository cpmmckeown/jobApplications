	<h1>Teaching and Learning Statement </h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>
	With over five years’ experience teaching in different institutions, across various ability levels, teaching both theoretical and practice-based curricula, I am an experienced lecturer and tutor that provides a student-centred approach, balancing content delivery with exercise-based active learning. My teaching practice is informed by an underpinning dedication to privileging student experience; a goal I achieve through a mixture of dynamic content delivery, making use of multimedia and interactive technologies, face-to-face contact time, and by allowing course content and exercises to evolve to the needs of students’ inquiries, feedback and demand. If successful in becoming a member of staff at TCD, I would aspire to build on my experiences putting them to full use within the department meeting the needs of the research community and students alike. 
	</p>
	<p id="TeachingOverview">
	My teaching experience can be divided into two distinct areas: my primary expertise is delivering core courses in theoretical and archival Film/Television studies and critical analysis of Digital Media Cultures. However, I also have experience teaching practical Digital Media Development (including digital-game and web design) and practice-based personal student development. I have had success as a lecturer, seminar tutor and workshop leader throughout my time at higher-educational institutions and have attempted to foster an approach to instruction that blends these skillsets together. My hope is that this diverse skillset would be particularly applicable to the department at Trinity due to the interdisciplinary nature of both the MPhil and undergraduate programs. I look forward to the opportunity to support students wishing to engage in traditional theoretical studies of digital media or to provide more practical avenues to those working in more experimental fields, particularly within the MPhil Digital Storyworlds elective module and doctoral study.

	<p id="MostRecentTeachingExample">
	As a lecturer, I was most recently involved in re-imagining and delivering the long-running History: Aesthetics and Genre course at The University of Glasgow. Working alongside Dr Rebecca Harrison and Dr Julia Bohlmann, the aim was to bring the course up to date with contemporary issues in Film and Television History. By fostering an intersectional awareness of the historical constructions of race and gender, we updated the previously implicit focus on great men in film history. We encouraged students to engage with the practice of making history, developing microhistories through exploration of physical and digital archives in object-lead research. The course placed a focus on team-based, summative exercises, in the form of presentations where students challenged a specific moment in film history. This was reinforced through two reflective, formative assessments with a greater emphasis on wider reading and research. Students were encouraged to critique their own actions through the course materials, placing a theoretical lens on their own narrativization of recorded events. Our hope was that this would foster more immediately transferable critical thinking skills. In asking students to critique their own academic practice, we encouraged a more personal, subjective engagement with course material, reducing the risk of students perceiving scholarly practices as removed from the everyday.

	<p id="ExampleTechtoTeach">
	While at Glasgow, I placed an emphasis on using familiar social media and online technology to assist in everyday teaching tasks. 
	Although University of Glasgow has a fully featured Moodle System, I have found that students' lack of familiarity with that system
	often prevents them from taking full advantage of the benefits it provides. As such, I did my best to make use of familiar technology such 
	as Twitter and something similar to Wiki pages. In 2017,  I was solely responsible for delivering the core Film Studies course, 
	'Film Aesthetics', to the entire single-honours student body.  
	As I had more personal input over how this course was to be delivered, 
	I made my course lecture notes freely available to the students by making a small website 
	through which each of the weeks' materials could be accessed. I found this made information more easily available 
	as students would not have to sign-in or be on campus to access course notes. 
	What's more, they were free to comment or suggest changes on documents by using Github.com, allowing the course notes to 
	freely evolve with suggestions from the student body. Equally, I was conscious that technology could give a 
	voice to more reserved students. As such, I made a simple Twitter account for the course and encouraged students 
	to respond with any questions 
	or comments they may have had. If time allowed, I could then respond to some questions at the end of lectures, or use them to shape seminar 
	groups later in the week. Though a small innovation, it encouraged real-time feedback 
	and forged an anonymous space for members of the class to ask questions without fear. 
	While this technological engagement was important for providing rapid input and helped shape the course in general, I equally encouraged 
	face-to-face contact time and held office hours 
	directly before or after class in rooms nearby to prevent a barrier being constructed between class and one-on-one 
	discussions.

	<p id="ExampleTeachingPractical">
	Before teaching at Glasgow, I had the privilege of teaching at Fife College, Dunfermline. Here, I was a lecturer on their 
	digital media programme, specialising in Games Design, utilising the expertise in programming developed during my 
	PhD research. I taught around 100 students how to go about developing games from start to finish, from having realistic 
	expectations, to gathering and developing visual assets, developing basic game engines (a 2D platform game) and the basics 
	of game narrative creation. On a higher level, I taught two classes of degree students specific courses on 3D modelling and 
	animation, focusing on using Autodesk 3DS Max to develop contemporary gaming assets that could be used in a full game. Narrative 
	was a central element within this class as working to tell a specific story through design helped keep students focused and 
	engaged with the tasks at hand. While at Fife I also taught web design and graphic design. In future, I would like to put 
	my knowledge of practical digital media development to good use in developing engaging and timely research methods.

	<p id="AttitudeToFeedback">
	Although I have always received positive feedback from peers and students alike, it is my desire to 
	continue to grow as a teacher. As such, I have sought feedback from classes and colleagues alike, 
	arranging external supervision above and beyond what was required of me, and asking students to complete 
	feedback exercises such as 'start-stop-continue', as well as anonymous initial and final impressions 
	questionnaires. With this feedback, I continually revise my approach to teaching and pedagogy, seeking 
	constant improvement. Alongside this, I have found that by being open with other members of staff, I am 
	able to better contribute to the academic community within my institution.
	</p>
	
	<p id= "Conclusion">
	To summarise, my experience in theoretical, archival and practical teaching, desire for innovation both 
	through new teaching techniques and a willingness to change and grow based on student and peer feedback 
	would allow me to be a valuable addition to any department. I believe that my particular skills relating 
	to constructing narratives through digital technologies, would be particularly well suited to the position available at TCD.
