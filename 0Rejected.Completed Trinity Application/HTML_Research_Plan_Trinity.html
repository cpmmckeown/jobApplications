	<h1>Research Plan </h1>
	<hr/>
	<p id="Intro">
	Since completing my doctoral research, I have become involved in 
	several post-doctoral research projects, some independently sought and others 
	institutionally supported. At the same time, I am actively involved in converting 
	my thesis into a book to be published through the Open Humanities Press and working 
	on the next steps of advancing that research project. Beyond publishing 
	my existing research, however, my aim is to extend my research beyond a focus 
	on the ecology of digital games and further suggest how computer software more 
	general prompts us to question the representationalist assumptions at the heart 
	of 'western' humanities scholarship. I have taken the fist steps towards developing 
	this next research in the paper "Videogames Beyond Representation" that will be 
	published as part of the 2018 international Trans-image summit held in Edinburgh 
	this coming April. Although I am focusing on exclusively on digital games now 
	it is my ambition to continue digging into the specific digital processes that underpin 
	specific programming languages - in particular, 'Q' the quantum computing language - 
	to uncover their often obscured artistic, social and philosophical 
	ramifications. In doing so, I hope to develop a truly 21st century philosophy and 
	continue blurring the lines between humanities and the sciences.

	Having completed my PhD I was fortunate to receive a small grant to undertake 
	postdoctoral training and research supported by the Scottish Graduate School 
	for the Arts and Humanities (SGSAH). I am currently working on a project 
	developing AI algorithms to play the Viking Boardgame 'Tafl', focusing on 
	the differences between simulating Tafl and Chess. Alongside this, however,
	I am working with the Glasgow-based independent publisher, Vagabond Voices 
	to develop small digital pieces with authors and publishers. At present I 
	am developing the second interactive map to help bring new levels of inter-media 
	engagement to the page medium and further mixed-media narratives. Through this 
	connection and through connections with the Glasgow University creative writing 
	MLitt programme, I am also developing an interactive poetry collection based on 
	feminist appropriations of witchcraft. Working alongside poet Heather O'Donnell 
	I am working to bring her experimental, tarot-inspired poetry practice to an 
	international audience through automation and digitisation.
	</p>
	
	<p id="PostThesisReseach">
	Although these projects will continue to be accessible beyond 2018, looking 
	past their completion it is my desire to bring some of the research completed 
	as part of my PhD to a larger public audience in a more accessible form. As 
	the majority of my research focused on independent games with ecological themes 
	I am in the process of applying to the AHRC and ERC for small grants to construct 
	an exhibition of ecologically focused digital games along with an accompanying 
	online curation space that will provide information and support for those hoping 
	to become more engaged with this burgeoning medium. At present it is my hope to 
	secure funding to cover the costs of travel and exhibition space for the US-based 
	artists, William Chyr and Ryan Green to hold an open forum on their work. 
	</p>
	
	
	<p id="">
	In conclusion, I have already taken steps to ensure my research grows and flourishes 
	into a larger research project with interdisciplinary aims, appropriate funding sources 
	and intentions to support international artists and practitioners. Out of this research 
	I believe a wealth of new course materials could be developed, investigating the intersection 
	between digital technology, the moving image and interactive media.
